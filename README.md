Estimate exchange effects after obtaining the ground state wavefunction without concerning 
permutation symmetry 

@ 1.0.0 
 - one dimensional hydrogen chain with pairwise interaction 
 - harmonic interaction 

@ 1.0.1 
 - output all fitting coefficients for r 

@ 1.0.3 

 - instead atom 1 and 2, choose other pairs

@ 1.0.4 

 - fix the bug of the analytical expression of p & derivative
 - still a bug 

@ 1.0.5 
 
 - try to fix the previous bug - momentum operator and exchange operator does not commute 
 - change mass to see effects 

@ 1.0.6 

 - use Morse potential instead of h.o.

@ 1.0.7 
 - fix a bug 
 - try h.o. again

@ 1.0.8 
 - reduce the distance

@ 1.0.9 
 - harmonic chain to test the correctness of code 
 - analytical results
